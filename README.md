# Description 

* Modals is a project where I built four different modals with varying looks and features.

* Modal one is what most people would think when they think of a modal. The user can escape the modal by clicking outside the modal or hitting the x button.

* Modal two is unique because it has three modals. With some DOM manipulation and the forEach method, all inherit the same functionality while keeping the code dry. The user is also able to escape the modals by pressing the ESC key.

* Modal three works by clicking on the open modal button. The modal overlay is fixed to take cover of the whole page.

* Modal four is my favorite because it resembles a real-time use case for a modal. When the user clicks the sign-up button, the modal will be fixed to the middle of the screen regardless of how far up or down the user scrolls. When the user submits their data, another HTML reads the query string GET request and displays it.
